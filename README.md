# Let's Get Technical (LGT) Bot

A Discord bot for the Let's Get Technical community that provides community engagement features, Twitch integration, and fun interaction systems.

## Core Features

### 1. Kudos System

- Members can give and receive kudos through reactions with the 'lgt' emoji
- Tracks user levels and points
- Features:
  - `/lgt kudos rank` - Check your or another user's rank, level, and points
  - `/lgt kudos leaderboard` - View top 10 helpful members
  - `/lgt kudos top` - Show most helpful messages (filterable by timeframe)

### 2. Book Club Management

- Unique moderation system where a specific moderator can "ban" users using the 'banhammer' emoji
- Achievement system with titles and custom images for ban milestones
- Features:
  - `/lgt bookclub bans` - Display the book club ban leaderboard
  - Fun titles for the moderator (e.g., "Supreme Ruler", "Grand Overlord")
  - Achievement unlocks at specific ban counts (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 69, 100)

### 3. Twitch Integration

- Webhook server for stream notifications
- Requires moderator permissions to manage
- Features:
  - Stream start notifications in a designated Discord channel
  - Subscription management commands (moderators only):
    - `/lgt twitch subscribe <username>` - Subscribe to a Twitch channel
    - `/lgt twitch unsubscribe <username>` - Unsubscribe from a Twitch channel
    - `/lgt twitch list` - List all active Twitch subscriptions

### 4. Special Interactions

- Custom reply system for specific users in the watercooler channel

### 5. Expiring messages

- `/lgt message send duration:<1 hour|1 day|1 week> message:<text>` posts in the current server channel and asks the bot to delete it after the selected time. While the bot is running, deletion should happen within about a minute after the deadline.
- The command response is visible only to you and its success confirmation disappears after about 10 seconds while the bot stays online. Failure warnings remain visible. The posted message shows your name and scheduled deletion time. Mentions in your text do not ping people or roles.
- Deletion depends on the bot staying online and retaining access to the channel; overdue messages are retried after a restart. Other members can still see notifications, screenshots, or copies before deletion.
- The bot stores message, channel, guild, and author IDs plus the deletion time in SQLite. It does not store the message text in its database.
- Install LGT Bot in the server with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes. Grant it **View Channel** and **Send Messages** in channels where this command is used, or **Send Messages in Threads** in threads. A user-installed app or a commands-only installation can display slash commands but cannot post or later delete these messages as the bot.
